A "Poker Machine" application.

This is my first Java application.  It is a console app I'm using to cement my 
knowledge of the basic language before I move on the the graphics library.

------
Classes
------

Card - A generic card class.  (Jokers allowed!!!)

Deck - A generic deck class.

PokerSlots - A class that handles the "slots", that is, the cards that are displayed.
	It also handles the scoring logic and the "hold cards" game interaction.
	This class owns the one and only Deck.

JokerPoker - The main app.  Instantiates the PokerSlots object.  Handles 
	user interaction through the console.	There will be an nAccount
	variable to keep the amount of money the player has.
